# task-knight-390
A incremental game task manager hybrid software.

Utilizes JS, CSS and HTML.

# Directions for organization

- Split different "modules" into different files.
- Everyone should be working in different files.
-   If you need more files for more functions, make them.

- CLARE & MARY: Works in MAIN/CSS/HTML
- BROOKE: Works in GAME FUNCTIONS
- MATTHEW: Works in TASK LOGIC
- RYAN: Works in (wherever cookie logic is held - likely MAIN?)
